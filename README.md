## Learning the mathematics

Read [this document](docs/shannon-lovasz.pdf) by Jiří Matoušek to learn about the Shannon capacity of a graph and to see how we can calculate this for the 5-cycle using a brilliant technique due to László Lovász.

## Remember

We are here to ask questions, to learn some Lean, possibly to learn some mathematics, but also to meet each other and to have fun.
